                    I first want to apologize to everyone for not doing a weekly recap the past few weeks. I’ve been super distracted
                    with a big crafting project & school stuff. But, I’m back! <br><br>
                
                    A lot of really projection-defying, ACL-tearing, heartbreaking, beautiful, amazing football has happened since I wrote my last article.
                    Instead of going through each matchup, however, I’m going to go team by team and do a quick analysis of where
                    they’re at & a little outlook moving forward. Let’s get started! <br><br>
                    <div class="line-break"></div><br>
                    <b>Avi</b><br>
                    I guess I’m not too surprised to see Avi sitting at the top of the standings. His team has some serious firepower,
                    and Diggs is sitting comfortably at WR2 on the season so far with no signs of slowing down. Avi also got a
                    lackluster performance from Evans in week 2 and was without him for week 3. Now that Evans is back, this team is
                    poised to put up some serious points on a regular basis. To me, that’s kind of been the theme of this season versus
                    others in the past - wide receivers are really making the runningbacks look like scrubs in fantasy. The 0 RB mindset
                    is flexing so far.<br><br>
                    Avi could be looking at a return for Tua relatively soon, too. It will be interesting to see how he wants to
                    approach his QB position between him and Carr - it will likely be somewhat matchup dependent. Tua has already shown
                    his upside in that offense, though. It’d be hard not to roll him out with confidence.<br><br>
                    Maybe the biggest surprise for me in Avi’s team is Miles Sanders: The King of the Deadzone RBs. Good for Sanders!
                    He’s looked great, and the coaching staff clearly sees him as the lead guy in one of the best offenses in the NFL.
                    Avi’s also holding onto Allen Robinson and Robbie Anderson in the hopes that one of those guys emerges and shows us
                    something close to what they’ve done in the past. Avi faces Josh this week who’s sitting at 0-4 and needs a win
                    desperately. Currently projected to win, Avi could move to 5-0 and begin seriously setting up a deep playoff
                    run.<br><br>
                    <div class="line-break"></div><br>
                    <b>Dennis</b><br>
                    Well, well, well. Look who’s second in the standings! Dennis will probably never stop giving me shit for ranking his
                    team as a C+, and you know what? He shouldn’t! Dennis has gotten amazing production from his RBs Chubb and Jacobs
                    who have both greatly exceeded expectations. I’ll admit it: I was totally wrong about Jacobs - and the rest of his
                    team. Josh McDaniels has FINALLY decided to have a clear lead RB. And, he’s getting a little passing work!<br>
                    Honestly, looking over these players, Dennis’ team looks amazing. It’s loaded with young, super talented WRs Chase,
                    Devonta Smith, and Chris Olave. What a powerhouse trio - one that is likely to only get better as the season progresses.
                    And, I have to really rethink my opinions on the split in Denver with Jeudy and Sutton. Russ has looked to Jeudy,
                    and if we can see anything close to the Russ we had in Seattle, the ceiling can get relatively high for Jeudy
                    quickly.<br><br>
                    Bench depth may be a concern down the line for Dennis with Mostert and Allgeier as his only real fill-in options
                    once BYE weeks start. But, his upside with his WRs is undeniable and should be more than enough to carry him
                    through. Dennis gets Jake this week, and he’s projected to win. Both are sitting at 3-1 and want to establish early
                    season dominance. This matchup is probably the most exciting this week in my opinion!<br><br>
                    <div class="line-break"></div><br>
                    <b>Al</b><br>
                    I finally get a little, tiny amount of redemption on my preseason rankings with Al in 3rd in the rankings. His team
                    has been able to consistently perform well enough to get the wins when it matters. His best 3 players, Allen,
                    Jefferson, and Andrews, have actually kind of stalled the past few weeks, but you can bet your ass that trend won’t
                    continue. With Pierce continuing to ascend and get quite literally 100% of the Texans carries last week, and Jeff
                    Wilson Jr. doing just enough, Al’s team has a supremely high ceiling.<br><br>
                    One of my favorite aspects of Al’s team is his bench depth. He’s got some really promising assets that will be
                    really helpful for the dreaded BYE weeks coming up. Hall, Pollard, Aiyuk, Doubs, and Mattison. Those are all players
                    on his bench right now. Yeah, it’s looking good. I wonder if Al might look to start packaging some of these guys up
                    and sending trade offers for upgrades in his starting roster.<br><br>
                    Al’s got Matt this week and (as of writing this) is currently projected to lose by 0.6. Matt’s sitting at 1-3 and is
                    needing a win badly. We’ll see if Al can seal the deal with some big performances out of his studs and stay towards
                    the top of the rankings.<br><br>
                    <div class="line-break"></div><br>
                    <b>Jake</b><br>
                    Jake’s team is another nice surprise for me in terms of performance this season. And, that’s taking into account
                    Jonathan Taylor being mediocre at best so far. In my preseason rankings, I said that Jake’s team screamed WR
                    strength. And, that’s exactly what it’s been so far for him. I’ll admit, I was worried about Tyreek Hill in
                    Miami. And, I was worried about trusting CeeDee Lamb who we’ve never really seen be exceptional as the #1
                    target. Yeah, went 0 for 2 on those calls. But, Jake knew better, and he’s got 3 wins to show for it. Something
                    that may be concerning for Jake long term is that he’s got the lowest Points Against in the league so far. It
                    could get hairy facing some of the more explosive teams later down the line.<br><br>
                    With Jonathan Taylor confirmed out this week, Jake is going to have to wait a little longer to get the huge 30
                    point breakout game from him. But, that’s fine! Because you know what? Jonathan Taylor’s done this before. It
                    has taken him a little while to get going the past 2 years, but we all know why he was the #1 pick this year. I
                    expect big games down the road for him. Since Jake already has 3 wins, he’s in much better shape to weather the
                    storm while waiting for Taylor’s return.<br><br>
                    Jake’s also going to need a return to major volume for David Montgomery in his return from injury. Khalil
                    Herbert has been a little inconsistent in his absence, but he’s shown flashes that Montgomery has really only
                    ever shown us at the end of the 2020 season. As mentioned before, Jake’s got Dennis this week, and it should be
                    a really exciting matchup between two very good fantasy teams. Dennis is probably counting his blessings that he
                    doesn’t have to stare down Jonathan Taylor just yet.<br><br>
                    <div class="line-break"></div><br>
                    <b>Regy</b><br>
                    I can imagine being Regy right now. Sitting there with Saquon, Kelce, Waddle, and an overperforming Singletary
                    and still 2-2. Well, that’s how competitive this league has been this year, and I couldn’t be prouder. McCaffrey
                    still hasn’t really gotten rolling yet in the passing game, and I think Matt Rhule’s days of coaching the
                    Panthers may be coming to end very soon - partially for that reason alone. McCaffrey did finally get a little
                    involved in the passing game last week, but it was all in garbage time. Matt Rhule is a clown.<br><br>
                    Regy’s going to be fine moving forward. Tua’s going to come back and feed Waddle, Saquon is looking unbelievably
                    good again, Godwin’s coming back, Singletary is on the Bills, I mean the list goes on. Regy <em>does</em> have
                    an issue at QB, however. Geno has been looking pretty good so far, but it just feels kinda yucky to have to rely
                    on him. Especially since he’s got the Saints this week.<br><br>
                    I like Regy’s bench outside of Gesicki. Regy, if you’re reading this, drop him right now and pick up someone
                    else. Look, go Phins, but you don’t have to do this to yourself anymore. Also, I should mention that Regy’s
                    going to get Hopkins back in just 2 short weeks, which will help his already good team get better. Regy’s got me
                    this week, and I think it may come down to my FLEX decision which I will ultimately get wrong and lose because
                    of it.<br><br>
                    <div class="line-break"></div><br>
                    <b>Chris</b><br>
                    It’s kinda weird bouncing between 1st and 3rd person. Sorry if that’s been confusing for you, too. Well, I was
                    feeling really good about my team to be honest. I was finally starting to see vintage Henry, Pittman was looking
                    like a target hog, and Jalen Hurts is just balling all over the NFL right now. But, wins have been kind of hard
                    to come by for me. I’ve basically just choked on my TE position every week, and my RB2 Javonte Williams has torn
                    his ACL and is out for the season. Devastating loss. But, it doesn’t really matter that much because I was wrong
                    about his outlook anyways. He was in a 50/50 split just like last year, and I got it completely wrong. At least
                    I got Melvin Gordon right? *throws up*<br><br>
                    I think I need to rethink my fantasy strategy of drinking heavily and then trading with Luke. Ah, who am I
                    kidding? I love it! My bench depth is okay, and I’ve got some upside plays in case things shake out favorably
                    for me. I also had some seriously disappointing performances from Pittman, Cooks, and Kirk the past few weeks
                    that have really hurt. But, I don’t expect it to continue to be that bad for them. Honestly, Gordon might be
                    better for my team now that Javonte is out than Javonte would be in the prior situation.<br><br>
                    I’ve got to take on Regy’s team, which is way better, and has more upside, hasn’t torn any ACLs, etc. It could
                    be rough. I’m needing Jalen Hurts to go nuclear, which he’s super capable of. <br><br>
                    <div class="line-break"></div><br>
                    <b>Eric</b><br>
                    Eric, the Comeback Kid! Even ESPNs big brain autodraft that gave Eric every single Tight End in the NFL couldn’t
                    hold him back! This team has really benefited from CEH’s high efficiency combined with Kupp just continuing
                    exactly what he did last season. And, how about DK? This is where I admit I was totally wrong about him. I
                    mentioned Geno earlier, but he’s honestly been pretty decent for DK in fantasy.<br><br>
                    There’s still some pretty big question marks for my boy Eric. Conner is not delivering on his draft cost, Elijah
                    Moore has been overshadowed by Garrett Wilson to this point, and even Herbert hasn’t played up to his standard.
                    I don’t think the Herbert one is concerning at all, and I think Zach Wilson could start looking for more Moore
                    :3 eventually once he’s settled back into the offense. <br><br>
                    I’m excited to see what this team could do. It’s got major upside, and if the efficiency continues, this could
                    be a scary team to go up against on any given week. Eric is playing Luke this week who’s 1-3, and it should be a
                    pivotal moment for both teams in their outlook. Super exciting matchup!<br><br>
                    <div class="line-break"></div><br>
                    <b>Katie</b><br>
                    Oh man, this one hurts! It’s okay, it’s early. Deep breaths, deep breaths. Katie has taken a couple of losses so
                    far, but I think everything is F I N E. She’s still super well set up for a dominant run. Basically any fantasy
                    team with Lamar at the helm is going to be able to put up huge numbers, and she’s got some other studs like A.J.
                    Brown and James Robinson that will help bring week winning performances.<br><br>
                    However, she’s going to need Kamara back. Like now. Antonio Gibson and Damien Harris are not enough to keep this
                    team afloat for the weeks Kamara is missing. Add to that the fact that DJ Moore has just been a complete
                    disappointment so far (I have him in dynasty, Katie. I feel your pain *cries*), and Waller hasn’t returned on
                    draft capital either.<br><br>
                    It’s a long season, and there’s plenty of talent on this team. Just need to push through, get Kamara back, fire
                    Matt Rhule, and start getting Gabe Davis the ball more, and boom! Katie is playing Dillon this week who is 1-3.
                    Both teams looking to get back on track after a disappointing start - can’t wait to see how it unfolds!<br><br>
                    <div class="line-break"></div><br>
                    <b>Luke</b><br>
                    Luke’s gotten off to a rough start so far, but he got an impressive win over me this past week. I really didn’t
                    do myself any favors by pushing that Tee Higgins trade through.. Luke has been in this situation plenty of times
                    in the past, and he’s got a very specific strategy to handle it: make a shitload of trades. It’s saved him in
                    the past, and he’s really good at packaging guys for key upgrades at certain positions. It’s week 4, and you’d
                    barely recognize this team from the one he drafted.<br><br>
                    Luke’s honestly looking really strong right now. I like his core of RBs with the (hopefully) emerging Stevenson,
                    steady producing Fournette, AJ Dillon, and he should be getting Brian Robinson back sometime over the next few
                    weeks after his speedy recovery. He’s also really strong at WR with Tee Higgins, Davante Adams, and Keenan
                    Allen. I’m always surprised how Luke can do so many trades and upgrade basically everywhere. He’s a master of
                    his craft.<br><br>
                    I think if he had this team week 1, he would definitely not be 1-3. He also leads the league in points against
                    with a whopping 480.48, so he’s been pretty unlucky in that regard. I expect him to rebound quickly over the
                    next few weeks with his newly revitalized roster. He’ll be taking on Eric, and I expect it to come down to the
                    wire.<br><br>
                    <div class="line-break"></div><br>
                    <b>Matt</b><br>
                    Matt’s also gotten off to a slow start at 1-3 thanks to disappointing performances by Dalvin Cook and Juju. Ertz
                    has been a pleasant surprise for Matt, however, and is sitting at TE4 on the season right now. That was a huge
                    surprise to me. His targets could definitely come down with the impending return of Hopkins.<br><br>
                    Matt has some really good pieces, and I think he can still get wins moving forward. He needs Mahomes to start
                    having more games like week 1, and he may want to take a serious look at his FLEX to see if Juju is really the
                    best option there. Robert Woods could see a huge increase in volume with Burks missing time, Amari Cooper has
                    shown some really unexpected flashes, and even Gallup could surprise and start getting super involved in his
                    return.<br><br>
                    Matt will be taking on Al, so his work is cut out for him. It’s tough recovering from a 1-4 start, but certainly
                    not impossible. Matt’s players also have some juicy matchups this week that his star players like Mahomes and
                    Cook can really benefit from.<br><br>
                    <div class="line-break"></div><br>
                    <b>Dillon</b><br>
                    Dillon, I promise I feel your frustration. Kyle Pitts… what a nightmare situation. The most talented tight end
                    prospect of all time coming out of college, and what QB does he get in his second, supposed breakout year??
                    Marcus fuckin Mariota. I have Pitts in dynasty and had to take him in the 2nd round to get him, so I’m
                    incredibly familiar with the frustration Dillon is feeling right now. It almost feels like you gotta bench Pitts
                    at this point and play someone else like Irv Smith or even Hayden Hurst. But, you can’t do that! Benching Kyle
                    Pitts??? That’s blasphemous.<br><br>
                    Dillon’s issues don’t end there, though. Najee has been incredibly underwhelming, Toney isn’t involved at all,
                    and Russ looks bad in this Denver offense to this point. Dillon was smart to grab Khalil Herbert who I think can
                    maintain heavy involvement in a Chicago Bears team that wants to run the Army-style triple read, never throw the
                    ball once, offense. The only problem with that is that they suck.<br><br>
                    Luckily for Dillon, he also grabbed Joe Burrow who I imagine is going to be starting for him until Russ does
                    something of merit. It’s hard to know whether the arrow is pointing up or down for Garrett Wilson with Zach
                    Wilson coming back. Curtis Samuel was super involved in the beginning of the season, but has kind of been
                    lackluster since. Dillon’s going to get huge weeks from Aaron Jones and St. Brown which will hopefully be enough
                    to make up for the disaster that is Kyle Pitts in 2022. Dillon’s playing Katie, and he’ll need a lot of help
                    from his young players to come out on top.<br><br>
                    <div class="line-break"></div><br>
                    <b>Josh</b><br>
                    Josh’s woes have continued since week 1, taking 4 losses in a row to start the season. He’s also third in the league
                    in points against at 453.48, right on par for Josh's fantasy teams.
                     Ekeler has been all over the place with his production, and Josh made it a point to
                    trade last week with Luke to try to turn things around. He’s got Swift and Michael Thomas on his bench, and I
                    anticipate big production from both of them when they return. Josh can absolutely go on a run after this week
                    and rack up wins, he’s just gotta survive the next 2 weeks with either winning both or going 1-1. It’s
                    definitely not over for him yet, and he has the right mindset for setting himself up to rebound.<br><br>
                    It’s difficult to evaluate a lot of his players like Kittle, Lockett, and Mike Williams. They all have
                    individual cases to make for being league winners, but you’re just not seeing consistent production from any of
                    them. We all know Kittle is one of the premier tight ends, so that one is easy to forgive. If Geno can keep it
                    up, Lockett will be useable with touchdown upside. Mike Williams has Herbert throwing the rock, so he’ll always
                    provide a week winning upside type profile.<br><br>
                    Unfortunately, Josh has to go up against Avi’s 4-0 star studded squad. It won’t be easy, but it is winnable. He
                    needs to get a W either this week or next, in my opinion, but this may not be the week for it. Hang in there
                    Josh! (Luckily, his dynasty squad is STACKED!)<br><br>
                    <div class="line-break"></div><br>
                    Well, there’s our week 4 recap! I’m so happy to see everyone competing so intensely. Fantasy football is one of
                    my absolute pure joys in the world, and you are making it the best year yet. I love you all! Good luck this
                    week!<br><br>
