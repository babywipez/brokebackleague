          <p>I just want to say, these teams look great. Honestly, I think every single team has a chance to take down the championship. 
            I’m going to do my analysis from the first pick in the draft moving to the last. <i>Remember that these are just all my opinions</i> - I’m not an expert, 
            and there’s surprises every year! Let’s dive in!</p><br>

            <p>Jake’s team screams wide receiver strength. The potent combination of CeeDee Lamb (who I thought was a great value here) and Tyreek Hill provides a huge, 
              game-breaking ceiling with what should be a safe floor. His late round dart throws like KJ Hamler and Jahan Dotson are some of my favorite picks of his - 
              especially Dotson. Jonathan Taylor stabilizes his RB room which could get a little shaky if Montgomery is in a timeshare in a bad offense, Hunt sees less targets 
              with Brissett at the helm, or McKissic just isn’t that efficient with his touches. I liked the fact that he waited on TE after the studs came off, and Hunter Henry 
              could be a touchdown machine this year. I would have liked to see him wait on K and D/ST just for two more rounds and grab some more proven depth, but I think it 
              worked out fine considering who he was able to get with his last 3 picks.</p><br>

            <b>D/ST:</b> Dolphins<br><br>
            <p>Regy took a really upside-focused approach with this draft, and I love it. He doesn’t shy away from taking CMC 2nd overall, and he doubles down on his upside by 
              taking Godwin and DeAndre Hopkins, knowing he might have to be patient at first, but securing potential league winners down the stretch. It’s hard to even have a 
              discussion about upside without talking about TREY MF’ING LANCE BABY!! Lance has immense potential as a Lamar Jackson circa 2019 esque type player that just completely 
              breaks the game of fantasy football. Oh, and Regy has Travis Kelce, too. Regy will have to rely on Saquon, Waddle, and Bateman to be steady producers while this team 
              reaches their final form. If he can survive the initial stretch of the season, and his players hit their upside, Regy will win the league, and it won’t be close.</p><br>

            <b>D/ST:</b> Ravens<br><br>
            <p>So, looking over Josh’s team, the theme I’m seeing here is volume. It’s so interesting seeing the different ways people approach the draft and players they like, 
              and I can tell by looking at this one that Josh really values guaranteed volume. Ekeler and Etienne are a strong pair at RB, and I think Etienne in the 5th round 
              is a really good value. Both should see a ton of touches and a lot of passing work. Keenan Allen, Tee Higgins, Diontae Johnson - can you pick 3 guys with more 
              guaranteed volume than them?? We were on Discord while the first part of the draft was going on, and I talked up Michael Thomas (who I would have absolutely picked 
              in that round if Josh hadn’t). I just hope I don’t regret that for his sake! Josh is also elite at TE with Kittle - sure there are some question marks about 
              how Lance and Kittle will mesh. But, it’s Kyle Shanahan people! Trust the process. </p><br>

            <p>I had so many moments reviewing Eric’s players where I remembered being ONE PICK AWAY from getting them, and he snatched them up before I could. I think Eric 
              got really nice value on a few of his players including Herbert, Schultz, MVS, and the Colts D. The thing I’m struggling with here is that he’s missing some crucial 
              depth at RB and WR. I would have really liked to see him trust in Schultz enough to pass on Freiermuth and Fant and grab some depth there instead. Eric may be 
              needing to hit the waivers sooner than later, but his starting core can definitely put up some numbers. I think Akers was a little too soon there in the 3rd, and 
              I’m just totally out on DK Metcalf at that spot, too. (Link me this article when DK goes off this year). </p><br>

            <b>D/ST:</b> Browns<br><br>
            <p>Overall, I think I have to stop drafting Jalen Hurts. This is the 3rd team I’ve drafted him in, and I feel like it’s going to come back to haunt me. I do love my 
              team, and even though I’m ridiculously weak at tight end, I’ve always been able to just stream the position in the past. I have a great combination of vets, youth, 
              upside, volume, rookies, everything you need. I did have to reach on Dillon a little in the 5th, but I was comfortable with that since I got Pittman in the middle 3
              rd which I thought was incredible value. My Javonte pick in the 2nd was also probably a slight reach, as well as Nyheim Hines in the 8th. These are all just guys I 
              like a little more than consensus. WR depth could be an issue if my young guys don’t pan out, and my strength is easily my RB room. I also got my #1 kicker this year ;)</p><br>

            <p>I’m doing these in order, so I haven’t finished everyone, but I know I’m giving this team an A+. Al goes 4 straight non-RBs to start the draft in a half PPR league. 
              How can a team possibly recover from that? Breece Hall, Dameon Pierce, Tony Pollard, that’s how. I even don’t like his Terry McLaurin pick in the 3rd (would have 
              rather seen AJ Brown or Mike Evans there), and it’s STILL an amazing team. Andrews could easily finish #1 TE, Jefferson is my WR1 this year, Josh Allen should finish 
              #1, Hall could be the 1A as early as week 2 or 3 in NY, Dameon Pierce is a baller, I mean the list goes on. I’m kicking myself for taking Carlson (haha, get it?) 
              instead of Pacheco there in the 13th round. God, what a complete miss on my part. I would be absolutely stunned if this team doesn’t make the playoffs.</p><br>

            <b>K:</b>  Jake Elliot<br>
            <b>D/ST:</b> Steelers<br><br>
            <p>This is another team I really like. Dillon had a great start to the draft with Najee and Aaron Jones, and he takes the elite TE option with Pitts in the 3rd. 
              If Elijah Mitchell stays healthy, I see him leading the 49ers in carries easily, and he’s a great option in half-PPR since I don’t project him to see a lot of 
              passing work. I thought it might have been a slight reach on Kadarius Toney in the 6th round, but then he circles back and gets Thielen in the 7th which totally 
              redeems it. I also wasn’t sure about taking two top 10 options at QB, but when Burrow falls that far, I get it. He then snags the rookie Wilson who was my favorite 
              WR coming into the draft this year. There are certainly some question marks in his WR room, but nothing too concerning. The real dilemma for Dillon will be whether 
              to start Mostert in the first few weeks of the season while his legs are still working.</p><br>

            <b>D/ST:</b> Packers<br><br>
            <p>After taking Chase in the first, Dennis takes 3 players that I find myself pretty low on overall. Chubb has been a steady producer the last 4 years, yes, but that 
              Browns offense looks disgusting. I still think Chubb has value and potential to finish top 12, but I would have much preferred a Saquon or Aaron Jones there. Jeudy 
              I think in the 3rd was just way too soon, especially with every single beat writer in Denver all but assuring us that Sutton will be the guy for Russell Wilson. 
              Dennis also clearly didn’t read my risers and fallers article, or he would have seen my concerns about Josh Jacobs. I would have liked to see Dennis grab Zamir 
              White later in the draft to see how that backfield shakes out. However, I think Dennis got great value on DeVonta Smith, Kenneth Walker, and Justin Fields. They 
              could all provide upside that some of his other players just don’t really have. I think taking the Packers D/ST in the 11th round was definitely a reach, and I’m 
              just kinda out on Patterson this year entirely. But, who knows, I’ve been known to be wrong before! I’m also playing Dennis week 1…</p><br>

            <p>Wow, what a mixed bag! I had to go check ESPN to make sure I got this right, but yeah, Matt only has 2 RBs on his roster. And, they’re not bad RBs to have, 
              but he might be looking towards the waivers very soon to sure up some depth there. My favorite pick of his was Sutton in the 4th round. I’m lower on Dobbins than 
              most, but in the 5th, that’s fine. I would have liked to see him pass on Mahomes there in the 3rd and grab a AJ Brown, Mike Evans, DJ Moore or even Zeke since 
              he was able to get Brady later. Matt’s definitely rich at WR, so he’ll have his pick of the litter when all of these guys show us who they really are this season.</p><br>

              brilliant! She also gets James Robinson a few rounds later in the event that he’s actually healthy and leads that team in carries, Tyler Boyd as basically a WR 
              handcuff to Chase and Higgins, and DeVante Parker with her second to last pick. I love this team. Perfect balance of everything you want in a star roster. Well

            <p>It’s so hard being in a league with Luke. Luckily, we were pretty far apart on this draft, but man, we are like targeting all the same guys. So, as you can 
              probably imagine, yeah, I love this draft. Luke went with Davante in the second, which I haven’t seen him do in our mocks, so that kinda surprised me, but why not? 
              The dude is probably the best WR in the NFL, and Carr can do enough to elevate him. A.J. Brown somehow falls all the way to the end of the 3rd round, and then Luke 
              grabs Mike Williams to secure his week-winning upside. Darnell Mooney was his next pick to stabilize that WR room a little, and he gets Rhamondre Stevenson in the 
              7th which I love. Kirk Cousins is criminally underrated this year, and Cole Kmet is just the poor man’s George Kittle. I screamed in anger when he took Joshua Palmer, 
              and then Luke told me last night it was by accident. Sure, Luke. </p><br>

            <p>Avi got some absolutely amazing player values in this draft. Mixon & Diggs is a common way I’ve started a lot of mocks, but none of them have Mike Evans coming back at 
              THE END OF THE 3RD ROUND! The value that Avi got on Robinson and Lazard I thought was also spectacular. I really like the way Avi handled his QB situation. Carr has the 
              best offense in front of him that he’s ever had, now it’s his time to prove he can be fantasy relevant. And, if he’s not, Tua also has the best offense <i>he’s</i> ever had, 
              and he has great upside. This is a rare circumstance where I think it’s completely fine taking 2 QBs - the other would be Trey Lance. I’m really low on Miles Sanders, but 
              if he’s the guy leading the RB room in touches behind that Eagles OL, he’s going to deliver. Nice job, Avi!</p><br>
            <p>My grade: B+</p><br>

            <p>Regy and I had an extremely similar thought last night as we finished up the draft. We had been looking forward to drafting for so long, it felt so strange when 
            it was finally over. It was a weird, cathartic experience blanketed by Coors Light.</p><br><br>

            <p>Well anyways, with the first game of the NFL season just days away, I wish you all good luck in the matchups to come!</p><br><br>
