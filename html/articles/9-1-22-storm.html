        <div class="article-text">
          <p>Can you hear it? The sounds of podcast uploads, rankings disputes, and millions of drafts echoing throughout the world. It’s football season.
          For many, this is a pretty unremarkable time of the year. Sure, it may save some poor souls who have run out of things to talk about with their
          family at Thanksgiving - we can <i>all</i> thank the Lions for that. But, otherwise, the world keeps turning and burning, and life goes on.</p><br>
          <p>But, not for us. This is the moment when we arm ourselves with our delusions and expectations. Our hatred for the injury prone, our love of steady
          volume, our lust for a W. But, I don’t need to tell you that. You’re here, admittingly probably confused, to understand why. Why? Why would I make a
          website for a single fantasy football league??</p><br>
          <p>I admit it’s pretty silly. As you’re extremely aware, I’ve become essentially obsessed with fantasy over the past few years. But, one fact has
          remained constant through all the mock drafts, wins, losses, drafts, and group chat texts: This league is my baby. The one that started it all.
          The love of my life.<p><br>
          <p>So, rather than continue writing a love novel about this league, let’s jump into some offseason discussion and the upcoming season! Today,
          I’m going to cover my preseason risers and fallers leading into this weekend.</p><br>
          <div class="line-break"></div><br>
          <p><b>Risers</b></p><br>
          <p>Dameon Pierce</p>
          <p>It’d be hard to not hear Pierce come up in discussion after the past 3 weeks. Crowning himself the Preseason Poseidon, Pierce has done what many
          (non Gator fans) thought would be near impossible by cementing himself as the clear #1 in the Houston backfield.</p><br>
          <p>It shouldn’t be <i>that</i> big of a surprise, though. He was a clear standout at the Senior Bowl, and even with limited opportunities in college,
          he was extremely efficient. He averaged 5.7 a carry on the ground, and 11.4 through the air in his senior season. And, he averaged over 6 a carry
          in his last preseason game along with a touchdown on the ground. The real discussion now is his ADP. Where’s a good spot to take him? He’s got juice,
          and he will clearly be the lead ball carrier for the Texans, but is that really something worth targeting with an early pick? With our league containing
          so many Gators, I see Pierce going earlier than ADP. But, if he’s got a solidified role in the passing game, he could easily be worth it.</p><br>
          <p>Gabriel Davis</p>
          <p>To call Gabriel Davis a preseason riser is almost disingenuous. He’s been a steady riser ever since his huge 4 touchdown playoff game 7 months ago
          against Kansas City. And, it’s no coincidence. The Bills with Josh Allen have shown that they’re a premier offense, possibly the best, in football.
          Who wouldn’t want a piece of that? Even with Diggs being the #1 target for Allen, it’s easy to see the path where Davis is #2. Combine that with them
          being one of the most pass heavy offenses in the league, and you can see the pieces falling into place for Davis to break out in a big way.</p><br>
          <p>Boom / Bust is certainly in Gabe’s range, however. I almost chose Isiah McKenzie as my second riser due to his standout performances in camp & preseason.
          I believe both of these guys will have huge weeks this season, but I’m not exactly sure what to project in terms of volume for either.</p><br>
          <p>Rhamondre Stevenson</p>
          <p>I was between Rhamondre and Brandon Aiyuk for my third choice, but I decided to go with Stevenson. I think I did this because I hate myself and
          want to get excited for a New England runningback in fantasy football. When has that ever hurt me? Bellichick won’t shut the hell up about Stevenson
          and Harris both being on the field during 3rd downs. I know that doesn’t necessarily mean more passing work for them, but it’s certainly more likely
          if Bill’s telling the truth. I honestly think they’ll just split the series down the middle, which wouldn’t be the worst situation. With no James White,
          and Damien Harris playing on the final year of his contract, Stevenson is set up for success. I do worry about New England’s offense as a whole, though.
          Matt Patricia and Joe Judge kinda scare me from getting too worked up.</p><br>
          <div class="line-break"></div><br>
          <p><b>Fallers</b></p><br>
          <p>Josh Jacobs</p>
          <p>Man, poor Josh Jacobs. This will be arguably the best offense he’s ever played in, and yet I’m really concerned about his outlook. If we’ve learned anything
          from a Josh McDaniels’ offense, it’s that there’s going to be a lot of guys and very little certainty over who’s doing what. It blows. Zamir White has
          been the talk of town in Las Vegas, and Abdullah projects (with absolutely no certainty) to be the pass catching guy. It’s a mess.</p><br>
          <p>But, it’s not all doom and gloom. If Jacobs can still get most of the work on the ground, the Raiders should definitely have more scoring opportunities than they’ve had in years
          past. The only problem is, they traded for the best red zone Wide Receiver threat in the NFL.</p><br>
          <p>Antonio Gibson</p>
          <p>Look, if you’re looking for a guy that returns punts, you’ve found your RB2. I’m just kidding, but seriously, this is a scary situation for Gibson.
          The only real confidence you can have at this point in him having any role at all in Washington’s offense is the fact that Brian Robinson is going to miss
          time from his horrible situation. (Wishing you a quick recovery, Brian!) I honestly think Gibson is one, maybe two, fumbles away from getting straight up
          cut from this team. I think the coaches are done with him. But, they may not have a choice come week 1. He’s the best talent in that RB room by far. And,
          you know the deal with McKissic.</p><br>
          <p>Dak Prescott</p>
          <p>I figured I should include a quarterback somewhere, so this seemed appropriate. I really think the reason Dak is sliding down ADP is because his offensive
          line has completely fallen apart over the past few months. And, you could even extrapolate this logic to Zeke, Pollard, and even Lamb. This Cowboys offensive
          strength has historically been twofold: Dak being an efficient passer combined with their elite offensive line getting the push for their runningbacks. Dallas is
          going from one of, if not the best, OL in the NFL to what projects to be one of the worst. I still think this will be a pretty good offense because I believe in
          Dak’s talent. But, it’s not hard to imagine the entire thing taking a step back this season.</p><br>
