                <p>What a spectacular first week of fantasy football! There’s a ton to get into, so let’s not delay!</p><br>
                <div class="line-break"></div><br>
                <p>Al Squeezes His First Win Out</p><br>
                <p>Well, my two titans of the league, Al and Katie, both earned a A+ from me in my team rankings. But, one of them had
                    to take the L this week. This one was a nail biter all the way to the end. Kamara and Moore took big stinky poops in
                    their pants for Katie while Al had to endure Pierce and Pollard barely being involved in their offenses. Luckily for
                    Al, his 0 RB-ish strategy worked perfectly as he got carried to a W thanks to Allen and Jefferson almost
                    exclusively. Jefferson looks like an absolute force to be reckoned with this season; everyone should be very afraid…
                </p><br>
                <p>Dennis Almost Proves Me Wrong. Almost.</p><br>
                <p>I was watching the Broncos Seahawks game, and my heart sank when I saw Jeudy’s huge touchdown catch. Was I totally
                    wrong about Sutton? It remains to be seen what the split in Denver is going to be with their receivers, but Dennis
                    looks pretty good so far taking Jeudy in the 3rd. Proud of him. Ja’Marr Chase is going to be Dennis’ best friend
                    this season as he seems to be Burrow’s get-out-of-jail-free card. We can only imagine what Chase might put up when
                    Burrow plays a good game! We both had a goose egg, mine from Irv Smith Jr. and him from Devonta Smith (what the hell
                    happened there??) I got Pittman right, so I’ll take this mild victory lap in the meantime.</p><br>
                <p>Josh Might Quit Fantasy Soon</p><br>
                <p>I’m going to have to take Josh out for dinner or something because the way his fantasy luck seems to go is just plain
                    fucked at this point. You couldn’t have painted a much worse picture for Josh’s team as his highest scorer was
                    Ekeler - who everyone was mostly disappointed with after this week. Jake’s team had disappointing players too,
                    however, as Aaron Rodgers has clearly taken one too many ayahuasca retreats this offseason. Ceedee’s outlook also
                    looks scary with Dak missing significant time in the next several weeks. I think higher scoring weeks are in both of
                    these team’s futures.</p><br>
                
                <p>C? Watch This</p><br>
                <p>Eric said in the group chat that my grade for his team was “generous,” but I’m not sure it was generous enough.
                    Herbert, Kupp, and CEH joined together in establishing dominance week 1. CEH was probably the most surprising, and
                    we can’t assume he’ll get touchdowns on a weekly basis, but he looks very improved from last season - and he’s
                    finally getting some decent passing work. Dillon’s team had pretty underwhelming production across the board outside
                    of the Steelers D/ST who dominated Burrow, forcing enough turnovers to open a bakery. Najee is questionable going
                    into this week, and Russ did not look good at all. However, I see a bounceback game from both Aaron Jones and Kyle
                    Pitts coming very soon.</p><br>
                
                <p>The Upside King</p><br>
                <p>I made it a point to talk about Regy’s upside in his fantasy team, but I got all the players wrong! Turns out, Saquon
                    is, in fact, back. Kelce did his thing too, and the Dolphins D/ST ruined every plan Bellichick had going into this
                    game. I’m going to chalk up Trey Lance’s game to the absolutely awful weather at Soldier Field. He still rushed the
                    ball a ton, and I expect him to make a slight improvement in passing in better weather. Matt is laughing at me right
                    now for criticizing his Mahomes pick as he absolutely dominated the position and reminded everyone why he’s the face
                    of the NFL. Matt started JK Dobbins, who was inactive for this game, but it wouldn’t have mattered. Saquon made sure
                    of that.</p><br>
                
                <p>Stop The Count!</p><br>
                <p>This was another really close game that came down to the wire in the Monday night game. I’d love to pat myself on the
                    back with a Luke win, justifying my grade I gave Avi, but alas. (It must have been infuriating watching Rashaad
                    Penny just refuse to get into the end zone time after time.) Avi had really solid production across the board, and
                    he should be sitting pretty most weeks with his stable of volume. If you had told me before this week that Swift,
                    Davante, and A.J. Brown would all get at least 20 points in fantasy, I would have bet the house on Luke winning. I’m
                    still trusting Mike Williams moving forward, especially with Allen out for the time being. Avi will have a difficult
                    decision to make with his RB / FLEX spots this week between Zeke, Sanders, Anderson, and (maybe?) Lazard. Seriously,
                    what the hell was that Robbie Anderson bullshit about? WE WANT MORE MOORE BAKER!</p><br>
                
                <div class="line-break"></div><br>
                <p>I wanted to get this out yesterday along with a waiver wire breakdown, but I’ve just been kinda busy with school and
                    drinking. Good luck to everyone in week 2!</p><br>
